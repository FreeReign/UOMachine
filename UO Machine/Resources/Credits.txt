Originally developed by Matthew "xenoglyph" Geyer.

Thanks to Artaxerxes, lead developer of UOAI (http://www.uoai.be). His assistance has proved invaluable and I appreciate it dearly.

A big thanks to Cheffe. Though he isn't involved with the project in any way, UO Machine wouldn't exist without his hard work. I've learned much of what I know regarding UO internals by reverse engineering EasyUO and the UO client.

Thanks to Christoph Husse for EasyHook, a brilliant API hook library.

Thanks to the SharpDevelop team for the nice AvalonEdit library.

Thanks to Daniel 'Necr0Potenc3' Cavalcanti for his hard work on UO encryption routines which he generously shared with the world.
