UO Machine is a scripting utility for Ultima Online. Scripts are written in C# and execute as native code.

Supported clients:

All Mondain's Legacy/Stygian Abyss 2D clients.

How to write scripts:

It's recommended to use the included Visual Studio 2008 templates to take advantage of code completion and refactoring features of the Visual Studio IDE. Don't forget to add a reference to UOMachine.exe in your project.

A GUI template is also included so that you can use the Visual Studio form designer to easily create a GUI script.
